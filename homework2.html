    <p>
      Mo:Mo: is very popular dish of Nepal. It is Nepali mandu. It is said to be
      originated from Tibet but later was popularized by Newari community from
      Kathmandu Valley. This dish can be said one of the favorite dish of Nepali
      people.

    <h2>How Mo:Mo: is made?</h2>
    <p>
      There are many ways of making this dish. Every Nepali has thier own way of
      making Mo:Mo:. And my family has also its own way to make. While preparing
      this dish, we need dough which should be very soft and smooth so it does
      not brust or have holes while rolling it into roti or adding the fillings.
      Fillings could be of anything. We can make of meat or vegetables only. But
      my personal favorite is of pork. But we can add any meat fillings like
      chicxken, buffalo's meat or beef.To making filling we need add mo:mo
      spices, ginger, onion and parsley. But we can add more ingridients
      according to our likings.

    <h3>My Family's way of making MO:MO:</h3>
    <p>
      First, take flour as much as we need for 3-4 people and make a dough which
      should be smooth. Then leave it for 2-3 hours inside the fridge wrapped in
      plastic. Between that time we need to make filling. We are going to make
      pork's momo so we take minced meat enough for 3-4 people. We put 4 table
      spoon of momo masala, one table spoon of ginger, add four finely chopped
      onions, half finely chopped cabbages and mixed it well. Add salt according
      to your taste. We can add MSG but it is not compulsary. We take a pan and
      heat 6 table spoons of oil and add it to the filling. Then mix it well.
      After fillling is ready, its time to roll the dough and put filling inside
      it by making beautiful design. The most challenging work while making momo
      is making design.
