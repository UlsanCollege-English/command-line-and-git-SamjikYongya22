    <p>
      Mo:Mo: is a very popular dish in Nepal. It is Nepali mandu. It is said to have
      originated from Tibet but later was popularized by the Newari community from
      Kathmandu Valley. This dish can be said one of the favorite dishes of Nepali
      people.

    <h2>How Mo:Mo: is made?</h2>
    <p>
      There are many ways of making this dish. Every Nepali has its own way of
      making Mo:Mo:. And my family has also its own way of making. While preparing
      this dish, we need dough which should be very soft and smooth so it does
      not burst or have holes while rolling it into roti or adding the fillings.
      Fillings could be of anything. We can make it with meat or vegetables only. But
      my personal favorite is pork. But we can add any meat fillings like
      chicken, buffalo meat, or beef. To make filling we need to add mo: mo
      spices, ginger, onion, and parsley. But we can add more ingredients
      according to our liking.

    <h3>My Family's way of making MO:MO:</h3>
    <p>
      First, take flour as much as we need for 3-4 people and make a dough that
      should be smooth. Then leave it for 2-3 hours inside the fridge wrapped in
      plastic. Between that time we need to make filling. We are going to make
      pork's momo so we take minced meat enough for 3-4 people. We put 4 tablespoons of momo masala, and one tablespoon of ginger, add four finely chopped
      onions, and half finely chopped cabbages, and mix it well. Add salt according
      to your taste. We can add MSG but it is not compulsory. We take a pan 
      heat 6 tablespoons of oil and add it to the filling. Then mix it well.
      After the filling is ready, it's time to roll the dough and put the filling inside
      it to make a beautiful design. The most challenging work while making momo
      is making design.
